# Credits

This project is a Python client for the **Boltz-2** protein structure prediction model.

## Boltz-2

Boltz-2 is developed by the **MIT Jameel Clinic** in collaboration with **NVIDIA**.

- **Paper**: [Boltz-2: Towards Accurate and Efficient Biomolecular Structure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.xxxxx)
- **Model**: Available via [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/mit/boltz-2)
- **GitHub**: [jwohlwend/boltz](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz)
